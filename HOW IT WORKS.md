This program uses a binary tree to find the answer. Each Question node is an interior node with Yes and No children. The Yes and No children are accessed depending on the user's answer. Each Answer node is a leaf node, it has no children because when an answer is reached, the program ends. 

When the program incorrectly guesses and is then taught by the user, the binary tree is updated with the new animal and the new question that allows the program to reach that new animal.

The program uses a file to store and read the binary tree.
